Reflection Agents
-----------------
* A tool that is used to enhance th equality of an LLM.
  - It helps the LLM by iterating the generation or a human text and gives feedback.

* The example reflection agent project is a tweeter generation agent. It generates tweets based 
  on user inputs and then refines them using another llm until the tweet is ready (in the project
  we just stop after n iterations).

* To build a reflection agent using LangGraph:
  - Define the nodes:
    * `generation_node`
      - This node generates a tweet based on user's input.
      - It also takes the feedback provided by the reflection node into account. This feedback is provided to
        the generation node via the `messages` (history) of the prompt.
    * `reflection_node`
      - This node takes the tweet generated by the generation node and critiques it
  - Define a conditional edge
    * `should_continue`
      - This edge is a function which decides if to stop the execution or not      
  - Define edges 
    * START -> `generation_node` -> `should_continue` -> `reflection_node` -> (back to) -> `generation_node`

* Example output between the two nodes:

`USER_INPUT`: 
Write a tweet about recent news events

`GENERATION (attempt 1)`:
Stay informed with the latest news events shaping our world. From politics to technology, there's always something new to discover. Stay tuned! #news #currentevents

`REFLECTION (for attempt 1)`:
Your tweet is informative and encourages engagement with current events, which is great. To enhance it, consider adding a specific recent news event or an intriguing headline to grab your followers' attention. This will make your tweet more engaging and timely. Additionally, consider adding a call-to-action, such as asking your followers to share their thoughts or feelings about the news. This can spark conversations and increase interaction on your post. Overall, your tweet is concise and to the point, but adding a bit more detail and interaction could make it even more impactful. Keep up the good work!

`GENERATION (attempt 2 with feedback)`:
Stay up-to-date with the latest news! ðŸ“° Did you hear about the groundbreaking discovery in the tech world? Share your thoughts on this exciting news event in the comments below! #news #currentevents

Reflexion Agent
---------------
* The goal of this agent is to give us a detailed article (from the web) about the topic that we ask about.
  - It finds articles online, summarizes and cites them.
  - Grounds the output with real data

* Architecture
  - Responder node
    * Responds to user input - generates: 
      - Initial response
      - Critique for the response
      - Search query to find information that can improve the response
  - Tools
    * Use the search query from the responder to find articles (online or in a knowledge base)
  - Revisor node
    * Takes the initial response, the critique and the result of the search tool and revisits the original response.
    * Supplies a new critique, citations and a new search query to revise the search

* The revisor-search loop repeats n times
